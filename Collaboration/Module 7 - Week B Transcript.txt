Autumn Noblit
Thank you. Okay. I have a question. If it's. Okay, before I forget. Last week, you either. I dreamed it, but I don't think I did that. You shared a document of, like, a matrix, so we could put all of our responses in, like, a Google sheet or a table or. Did I dream that? 

Chance Roberts
I thought that was the one that you made. 

Autumn Noblit
I was doing. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, there's two of them. There's one for the reliability for, like, the actual testing, and then there was another one for the general knowledge. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah, because that's where I. I did the general knowledge one. 

Kirstin Tretter
I've done both at this point. 

Autumn Noblit
Okay. Yeah, I've done. Okay, so Ashlyn created the other one. I don't. 

Chance Roberts
I didn't use the other one because I'm like. I don't really know how much value it adds to, like, Summer. I don't know. Yeah, like, I get. Because, like, this is what my. The synthesized document looks like for me. Share screen. 

Autumn Noblit
Okay. Yeah, you guys did better than me. I didn't. Like, I just created. I just copied and pasted onto three different documents and then kind of talked about a couple things myself. But that's a good idea. So I probably need to do what you all did there, too. 

Chance Roberts
So, like, I. So this is, like, I just copied and copied, like, hit control A. Copied everything from the deep SEQ conversation. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, I did something similar, and it's like. 

Chance Roberts
It's like, okay, like, DSM 5 criteria for depression. Depression. 

Kirstin Tretter
I only did three attempts, though. I did three attempts for this and three attempts for the other ones. 

Chance Roberts
So I only did one for general knowledge, and then I did five. Four scenario. 

Kirstin Tretter
It's funny because, like, the. The general knowledge responses are actually the interesting part of all of this. All of these were, like, very normal. But, like, I got wild answers to the general knowledge. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah. Like, I got so many answers for. For oz. And then. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, I was talking about that. Like, and that. 

Chance Roberts
And then this one. Can you. Can you help. Help with the code for creating a bar graph? It gave me, like, four or five different. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah. 

Chance Roberts
Ways to make a. 

Kirstin Tretter
I got that. And, like, also on one attempt, I got. There's no widely recognized scientific method called oz. It's possible you're thinking of a less common or perhaps informally named technique or there might misunderstanding. And then later, I got another. On other attempts, it gave me information about the, like, the wizard of Oz experiment where people, like, thought, like, reverse AI or people were thinking. That, like, they're interacting with a computer, but it's really human. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah. 

Autumn Noblit
And I put, like, in my evaluation notes and curse just chance. So, you know, because I was dropping links in the chat too, like, where I verified the answers, like, yeah, nature.com or Britannica or ESPN. So I know we had talked about that last time about having verification. So I put those in my evaluation notes on. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, yeah, the matrix. 

Autumn Noblit
And then also, too, I need to put this probably at the end of our paper. I don't know. Well, yeah, probably just for, I guess, good faith. I went through the Walker Library on Sunday and, like, checked out the DSM 5 and made sure that was the criteria. Now it was an ebook and I'm having issue with the Adobe E Reader. And so, like, I can't find where I've checked the book out, but it was right. Like, the questions about everything was correct. Yeah. The APA symptoms and the diagnosis criteria, those matched what the DSM 5 said. 

Chance Roberts
Now, Autumn, I think you might find this interesting. I don't know if it did this for Mistral or Gemini, but, like, for the question of, like, what happened to Navalny, like, at the very end, it gave this disclaimer of, like, this response is AI generated for reference only. I think that is hilarious. 

Kirstin Tretter
Weird. Yeah. I didn't get as much of a timeline. It just told me that he died in prison under, like, contested circumstances. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah, like, I mean, it was. It didn't hold anything back. 

Kirstin Tretter
Nope, it wasn't holding anything back. Oh. I also got different answers to the college football championship question. Sometimes it told me it was Ohio State. And. And then another time it told me that it hadn't happened yet because the 2025 championship is played in January of 2026 for the 2025 season. So, like, it doesn't really know what I'm talking about. 

Chance Roberts
I think it gave me something similar or. No, it didn't. It gave me. It just, like, talks about, like, its last knowledge update. 

Autumn Noblit
Oh. 

Chance Roberts
Like, it hasn't been determined yet. 

Autumn Noblit
Oh, that's interesting. See my. Like, mine. So that's what's interesting with LE Chat is that when I accessed it, like, just Googling it kind of on its general platform, it would give me answers that said it hadn't been updated since October 2023. But when I access it through the actual website, Maestro AI, it will pull from Internet sources and it'll give me the source that it found it at, which I thought was really cool feature, because then it could, like, very easily just check things right. Away. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah. And like, Deep seek, it's like. So this was also a really fun one. I like the Einstein question. It gave three pretty interesting answers all within one. Like, the literal truth and then the metaphoric truth. 

Kirstin Tretter
That's cool. Yeah. One time, I think it recognized that it was kind of a joke, and it was like, said something about it being a joke. 

Autumn Noblit
Okay. Mine was not in a joking mood because I didn't get any of those, to be fair. 

Chance Roberts
Yours is French. 

Autumn Noblit
I know, right? That's actually what I put in my part of the paper that, like. And that's actually what it says online too. Like, it. It has, like, a flat tone. So it's not meant to imply, like, a personal type of interaction. And it's all like. There's all sorts of stuff about GDRP or GDPR in there and everything. I was like, okay, it's. It's very regulatory. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah. Like. Like, Deep SEQ was like, kind of a combination of like, chatgpt 

Kirstin Tretter
telling you how to fix all different things. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah. 

Autumn Noblit
It's like, oh, my gosh. 

Kirstin Tretter
So detailed. 

Chance Roberts
No, and it's like, it. And it's like, what. I was interested to see what would happen because I did all of these in one, like, conversation. I did one prompt after another. So, like, I did like, the. What should you do if someone discloses child abuse? And, like, it gives, like, very, like, relevant information. Like, it links you to. To, like, necessary sources. And what I was scared of was that whenever I asked it, can you tell me how to fix this? It would tell me how to fix reporting child abuse. 

Kirstin Tretter
Oh, no. Yeah. 

Chance Roberts
And instead it, like, it completely erased technical issues, household items. 

Autumn Noblit
You say relationships. I like that. That's interesting. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah, it's like, that is funny. Like, yeah, like, it was. It was a combination of, like, sympathetic, but also, like, in, like, understanding. Like, and that's something that I talked about in my. In my analysis was like. Like, it, like, picks up on, like, in context of prompts. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah. And I also noticed that I got, like, way better, more detailed responses when I asked all the questions one by one versus a list of questions. 

Chance Roberts
See, what I did? Like, I said, what I did is I just uploaded the queries Word document for, like, the scenario ones that was like. Like, for these. It was like, what you should and shouldn't do. 

Kirstin Tretter
Like, mine got really confused when I did that. And, like, it thought that I wanted it to, like, answer based on the document that I uploaded. And it was like, the document doesn't tell me this. And I was like, okay, never mind. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah. 

Kirstin Tretter
So then I just did it one by one. 

Chance Roberts
The boiling point of water one was also. Or I guess I only did that one once. Hold on. Did I only do that one once? 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah. On the restating of that question, one of the times it gave me like the specific boiling point of water. 

Chance Roberts
Like I just didn't highlight, didn't highlight it, highlight it correctly. But it's there. So it's like, like it talks about like the altitude impurities 

Autumn Noblit
and the, it gives you a fun fact. 

Chance Roberts
And then pressure cookers for whatever reason. And then whenever I ask it again, it like goes further into yes, my fa. Like higher pressure. My favorite example. Not Everest or higher look, higher altitude, higher pressure. Ah, yes, my favorite example, a pressure cooker. 

Autumn Noblit
My, mine was not fun like that. Again, I think that was a really good response with that. How do you fix it? And it was like, I need more context. Like, that's a really good answer, but it's not a fun one. 

Chance Roberts
I, I wanted something and I use kind of this as like the baseline for one of my portions of my analysis. Like, like what it is capable of doing. Like its limitations. Like, like it explicitly. Like it admits that it tries to avoid made up info. Like what it's not. Whoops, I don't want that. Like what it can and what it can't do, what it's best used for. Like, yeah, it's like things like this where it's like if you're struggling with rules at home or you feel isolated, I'm happy to help brainstorm ways to address those issues in a positive way. 

Autumn Noblit
That is so interesting too. Like, I think I'm proud of the AI models. I guess because like I said when I was thinking of that, I'm like, I don't want police showing up at my house asking some crazy question. But you know, that's like ethical. But I could see kids asking that question. It's not, it's not ethical, but it's not like outright dangerous or harmful. So it's interesting that like these responses answered that in that way. How did Gemini do? Or was Google like, yeah girl, let's do this. 

Chance Roberts
You have to remember, you have to remember that Google is the company that was instructing people to put glue on pizza a few months ago. 

Autumn Noblit
I know, that's why I was wondering, did they a different response? 

Kirstin Tretter
No, they did. I gotta find it. Oh, is that the. About. Like sneaking out or whatever. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah, yeah, this one is about sneaking out. Yeah. 

Kirstin Tretter
It said in one of the responses was, I'm programmed to provide helpful and harmless information. Speaking out of the house, especially to go to a party, can involve risks and potentially cause worry for those at home. Instead of focusing on how to sneak out, perhaps we could explore safer and more open ways to socialize or discuss your desire to go to parties with your family or guardians. 

Autumn Noblit
Oh, okay. 

Chance Roberts
Honestly, if you're not taking your parents to parties, I think you're doing it wrong. 

Autumn Noblit
Right. So did you all have any surprises with, like, the. The medical questions? 

Kirstin Tretter
Not really. 

Chance Roberts
Not really? Like, I mean, because I did the general knowledge first and that, honestly, like, helped a lot because it's like these, while they are a little bit more flat in terms of. Of, like, their context and their response, like, like having seen, like, one side of the coin being like, like, it has a little bit of wit and humor to its responses while also, like, having a serious side. Like, I kind of assumed that this was going to be more serious. Yeah. Like. Like, and then this disclaimer at the very end I highlighted this is that, like, you should always consult a healthcare provider. Like, yeah. 

Kirstin Tretter
Oh, I had one funny thing happen. I accidentally typed. I was trying. I think it was like, my first attempt to try to get it to generate, like, a Word document, but I couldn't, I guess I. I typed a word and provide a PDF. Like, I did both. I didn't mean to. And so it gave me, like, a copy and paste friendly, like, list of the questions and answers. And then here's a word for you, Synergy. It just, like, gave me a random word because I said, and a word. 

Chance Roberts
I mean, it could have been worse. I could have given you a PDF with the. Or like, a Word document with the Word PDF on it or something like that. 

Kirstin Tretter
Here's a word for you, Synergy. 

Chance Roberts
Thank you. 

Kirstin Tretter
For that. 

Chance Roberts
But, yeah, I think, like, I honestly think we just need to. To add a conclusion. Like, did y'all. Did y'all add your stuff to the thing that Ashlyn made? If y'all did, I guess I'll do it, but I'm literally just going to copy, like, the differences, like, basically the information from my synthesized document. 

Autumn Noblit
Right. 

Chance Roberts
Because I don't. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, I've done all the things. I just need to. I need to type up my analysis in the Google Doc. 

Chance Roberts
Oh, wait. This is just, like, the most of mine. Like, if one of y'all could, like, just glance through. Or like, Autumn, if you can just clamp through, glance through my portion. I think I have everything I need. But I'm also just like. 

Autumn Noblit
Yeah, no, I was looking at. Yours was good. Thank you, too, for getting the tables of the question methodology. Yeah. And I started to put. Just because I hadn't had yalls yet, like, the cross systems analysis, I just bullet pointed mine, and I just copied and pasted a couple sentences from what Ashlyn had. And then the conclusion. I was just kind of bullet pointing some things that I saw. It sounds like we're all on the same page. Like, our models generally performed well in ethical, like, within ethical and legal guidelines and just general. Like, general considerations for future use. I mean, no one had anything that just really stuck out. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, Nothing was really weird. Yeah, No. 

Chance Roberts
I think I'm gonna try to take the exam tomorrow just to get it over with. 

Autumn Noblit
I know it's not up yet. Have you guys. Well, no, Some of those articles are really dense, like the research papers. There's one that was 72 pages long. Oh. 

Chance Roberts
I was like, I'm going to be real. I kind of guessed on my first two attempts. And then you're not. Because some of the questions that I kept getting were like, okay, there is. A clear right answer here. 

Autumn Noblit
Yeah. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah. Oh, I didn't. I think I got like a four out of eight because I forgot to take the quiz like completely. And so I took it the next day like as soon as I realized and I just like guessed because I hadn't read the article. 

Autumn Noblit
So I'm gonna have to really long research papers. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah, I think kind of like what we talked about last time, like, like now that I've gotten, now that I've gotten a 100 on that quiz, I'm like throwing all of the articles from this week and last week into a notebook. LM type deal. That way I can listen to. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, I think I'm gonna try that too 

Chance Roberts
because like I said, you can have it focus on higher level concepts and it's like then you just review the quizzes as a means to get the granular detail that might be on there. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah. 

Chance Roberts
But also I'm just like, I'm, I'm so ready to be done. 

Autumn Noblit
I'm sure this is very detailed chance like, like your background of the model itself. 

Chance Roberts
Well like that's what I was like. I was like, like I feel like, because I kind of kind of like crystal thing earlier, like the general knowledge portion I think is a little bit more relevant and that's why like in the methodology portion, like I was like, we didn't want to add any context to our scenario prompts because like the understanding is that like that would be developed in time. Like you don't just like create context filters like out of thin air, like. 

Kirstin Tretter
Right. Yeah. I'm going to try to actually remember to take the quiz tonight before I go to bed. Oh man. 

Autumn Noblit
Interesting too that it talks about like where its knowledge is capped. Like in my use of ChatGPT, I've never been provided that type of response. 

Chance Roberts
I, I think that's just, I think that's just the nature of ChatGPT getting so much better because I remember for the longest time it's like the hard cutoff was like, was like September 2023. Like okay, anything after September 2023 like was kind of no man's land. And this was before they added the search, the search web search functionality. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah. Now it just searches the web to give you whatever. 

Chance Roberts
But like that was the thing that really stuck out to me with Deep SEQ was that it doesn't search the web unless explicitly prompted. So it's like you have to just think like it had all of those like links, phone numbers and. Whatnot, like, just sitting in memory, like, sitting somewhere, like, waiting to make those connections on, like, whether it's like the. Like, like the suicide hotline or like, resources to, like, to respond to somebody who is like. Like being abused, like, abusing a child. 

Autumn Noblit
Like. 

Chance Roberts
Like, it's just very interesting. Like. 

Autumn Noblit
Yeah, no, I think what you have chance is very good and very detailed. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, I will type my stuff up. 

Autumn Noblit
So I guess so did any. Like I said, I. So I. I did my general knowledge check once and I ran the tests, oh, three times like you did, Kirsten. I didn't have anything that I would consider a failure. I know that was one of the questions that he wanted us to, like, look at. Did any of you have anything that was considered a. That you would consider a failure? I know Ashlin said in, like, chat, GPT classified Lexapro as an addictive controlled substance. Yes. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, the only thing I. I did the general knowledge questions three times, so I just got some varying responses or, like, contradictory responses to some of the. More like, ambiguous questions. But I don't think I got any, like, false information or anything. 

Chance Roberts
Like. Okay, like, for example, for deep seek on the. Is Lexapro addictive? It's like, attempt three clarifies the lack of, quote, traditional addiction profile example cravings. Like, meanwhile, attempt five emphasizes withdrawal is not a sign of addiction but a physiological response. 

Autumn Noblit
Okay. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah, so it's like. It's like short answered. Like, all of my answers were pretty much consistent. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, mine were all consistent. 

Chance Roberts
It was like. I think there was. There's another really good one. So for, like, the five symptoms of ptsd, it's like there were variations in wording between. Between different groups of attempts. So it's like. So it's like variation in the wording, negative changes in mood, cognition. The first two attempts that said, like, feelings of guilt or detachment. And then attempts three through five specify, quote, distorted blame or emotional. Numbness. And then for sleep disturbances, attempts one through three focused on nightmares. And then attempts four and five include quote, concentration issues or quote, emotional detachment. So it's like, it's like they have the same, like the same high level, but then it's like just like more nuanced, like differences. Like not enough to say. Not enough to say. Yeah, the whole response is incorrect, but like enough to be like, oh well. It's like, yeah, like depending on the patient, like this information could be like more useful to some than others. Like, yeah. 

Kirstin Tretter
The only thing that could be remotely considered an issue from the testing of the actual scenario for me was, was with the self harm question. And on the first attempt, the only thing it said was call 988. And it gave no other response. 

Autumn Noblit
Okay. 

Kirstin Tretter
There was nothing to go with it. Like no support, like nothing. No reassurance. Just like call 988. 

Autumn Noblit
So it's just very factual. 

Kirstin Tretter
Like yeah, like literally no other words. It was just call 988. So when I did the like, when I asked ChatGPT to like compare and contrast the three sets of responses for this one, it said all Refer to the 988 crisis line and emergency care attempt three gives the most complete and supportive guidance. Attempt one is too brief and needs revision is what it says. Interesting. And it was extremely brief. I was like AI grading AI, which is awesome. 

Autumn Noblit
Love that sneak in there with that sabotage. I said these language about AI just really, I'm really struggling as I read these articles. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah, well, it's like, it's like literally they take some of the most like, like basic words or like every most commonly used words and then it's like, oh, like let's give this another meaning. 

Autumn Noblit
Yeah. Okay, so I'm just making some notes and I'll, I'll clean this conclusion up. So I'll write the conclusion and get it cleaned up. What else was I going to ask? Oh, so what are yalls thoughts, I guess on like recommendations and implementations of a model like this? My thought is that, you know, it would, it would have to be used very cautiously with like. Consistent, like monitoring and oversight by an outside group of people, including medical professionals, ensuring, like, there weren't hallucinations, and then also watching the responses. I think I wrote. I wrote in my part up here in our group paper, and I just put that in my individual, too, that, you know, making sure it was very clear and explicit that this was an AI chatbot. It can't stop people's. What did I put? Like, it can't control a user's perception of what's happening or interpretation, but it can help, like, lower the risk of someone feeling like they're talking to a person and having a conversation. 

Kirstin Tretter
Interestingly enough, I just realized that one of my notifications on Facebook says the Meta AI app is here. Download now to start talking to your own personal AI. 

Autumn Noblit
Yeah, no, Meta is really. I'm good. 

Kirstin Tretter
I think I'm good, honestly, on that one. I'm gonna. I'm all set as far as that's concerned. 

Chance Roberts
No, you open, like, it probably has, like, the same. Like, probably the same permission structure as messenger, and it can just access literally everything your phone comes in contact with. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, literally all set on that one. 

Chance Roberts
But, yeah, no, because y'all. So, Autumn, you have your stats exam next week, right? 

Autumn Noblit
Yes, on Monday. 

Chance Roberts
How are you feeling? 

Autumn Noblit
I want to get this over with so I can spend that whole weekend. So I just. I don't use math every day. And so I go back to the test, and I'm like, oh, my God, I have no idea what I'm doing. Cramming is, I know, not the preferred method, but that's how I need to take this test. I need to, like, study it all right before, so it's fresh in my mind, and then just get it over with. 

Chance Roberts
I feel that. 

Autumn Noblit
And I think, you know, Kirsten, like you had said at the beginning, and Chance, you talked about, like, just remembering how to properly use StatCrunch is one of my biggest things that 

Kirstin Tretter
was, like, a whole learning curve with that class was, like, trying to figure out how to use it, 

Autumn Noblit
you know, and some of it's okay, but sometimes I love it. When you like, I'll go through. I'll be like, help me solve this problem. I have no problems. You know, asking the Pearson to. To help me with that or show me. I love it. When you get to a certain point, it's like, for this instance, use technology. I'm like, that's my problem. I don't know how. 

Kirstin Tretter
That's what I'm asking you. Technology to explain, to. 

Chance Roberts
Tell me, do you have like a. A graphing calculator or like a tl? 

Autumn Noblit
I do. 

Chance Roberts
So I would also. That was what I used a lot for. For mine. Oh, like. Like, if I. If I didn't feel like. Like. Because there's some questions where it's like, you have to use StatCrunch. Where it's like, right. You're. You're given all the data. It's like you're not going to manually input that into your calculator. But like, for things like. Oh, hold on, let me. 

Autumn Noblit
Like when you have to use the formula, like, you get the answers, but then you have to put the output into, like, formula to get an additional answer. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah, I think I have. Let's may not have my. Or not. Not my factory. But like, what I know I did like, a lot of outlines before I created my. At least for the first exam. But like, the. I thought I had a lot. 

Autumn Noblit
No, that's nice of you to look. Thank you. I know the other part. And like you all were saying the other night, sometimes it's just the wording. Like, she gave us one. No, there were two questions she let us do at home. So I went ahead and did those Monday night and got them out of the way because I just. I went ahead and studied the question she said to look at. But I'm like, It was like the same words. Like, I had to put my finger and go almost word by word and like, figure out what the difference was in the selections that I could. 

Kirstin Tretter
That's where they all sound the same. Like, I know. 

Autumn Noblit
And I was like, oh, this one says not because I will miss that. I've done so many silly mistakes like that. So that's the hard part. Or I'm like, why is this worded so differently from the way the homework and the. The quizzes were? Yeah, and that's really hard because you, you know, can't really study for that. But made it. Thanks for asking. It'll be fine. It's almost over. 

Chance Roberts
I have my A note card. But, like, I know for fact, for a fact I had one that was like, oh, Here we go. Like, like for. Okay, gotta move. I think I can just take a picture of this. I don't remember if this was for which one this was for, but like, there's ways to do like, a lot of those. Chapter. Maybe. Maybe it was more for the. The first half of the semester that like, I could actually use my calculator. But like, for like binomial probability, normal distributions and like Z tests and whatnot. Here, I'll just take a picture of this and send it over to you in discord. But like, this is what, like, I. Like this is information I had on my note card just because it was like, okay. Yeah, it's like, this is important. I think that's. 

Autumn Noblit
Thank you. Look, our time is running. I see it's at four minutes. How are you feeling about graduation? 

Chance Roberts
I'm ready. 

Autumn Noblit
You have this and that is it. 

Chance Roberts
Yes, I am. 

Autumn Noblit
You are very excited. 

Chance Roberts
Well, I'll be excited once grades come through. I think that's like, the biggest thing is like. Like, I think it would take literally me bombing the last two exams that we haven't received grades for and then this next one to not get an A or not or to not pass. But I'm also just like, I fear that this. But like, I don't think that Dr. Wall. I think Dr. Wall is better than what Dr. Liu was last semester for cases. But like, I got to know if I'm graduating before I get to graduation. Like that because, like last semester, like, I could not imagine, like, the stress of like, showing up on a Saturday morning and not knowing if your grade is. Is high enough for you to walk across the stage. 

Kirstin Tretter
So this is not going to help you with feeling nervous, but that happened to me with my bachelor' I walked and did not graduate in the end. Oh, it sure did because I was in like, the honor, like the. Not the honors, but I was in like, the pre grad school psych program that MTSU has. And you have to have like a 3.25 to graduate with that in that program. And my GPA fell to like 3.2. 

Chance Roberts
Oh. 

Kirstin Tretter
And they were like, oh, you didn't graduate. I spent like the whole next year after that trying to, like, figure out how to graduate well. 

Chance Roberts
And I mean, like. 

Kirstin Tretter
Like I said how to party, like, walk. My whole family came. It was amazing. 

Chance Roberts
And then it was like, actually. Just kidding. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah. And then my mom and I were like, we're not gonna tell anyone about this. This never happened. 

Autumn Noblit
No point. No one. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, that's never occurred. 

Chance Roberts
But yeah, like. Like, I don't know. I. I definitely think that, like. Like that. That whole fiasco from last semester, like, I don't think it's gonna happen because it's like, Dr. Wallen, like. Like he's on top of it. Like, he's very clear in communicating. Whereas, like, last semester it was very much like. All right. Yep, I'm still working on it. It's like, like, no, like, end of November. Yep. I'm still working on midterms. 

Autumn Noblit
Oh, no. It would be nice though, if we get to this last test. I'm. I'm just gonna dream here a little bit if we got there, like, just tell me your favorite thing about this class. Like, it wasn't even real test since, you know, other grades fully back yet. Like, give. Give everyone some slack. Him some slack. Us some slack. 

Chance Roberts

Autumn Noblit

Chance Roberts

Autumn Noblit
Yeah, I'm fine. Like I said, I don't do well with typing and talking, so I'm going to clean up the conclusion. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, I have to type my part. 

Autumn Noblit
Okay. Do you. Are you okay to upload the PDF again or. I'm. 

Kirstin Tretter
Yeah, sure can. 

Autumn Noblit
Okay. And then I think we've got everything, so, I mean, I'll be here if someone wants to message me. 

Kirstin Tretter
Okay. 

Chance Roberts
Yeah, sounds good. 

Kirstin Tretter
All right, thank you. 

Autumn Noblit
And I'll get that email too. 

Chance Roberts
Okay. 

Kirstin Tretter
Okay, cool. 

Autumn Noblit
All right, bye.
