[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
All right, there we go.


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
Oh, thank you so much.


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
Not a problem.


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
Thanks for...


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
And I'm going this and all that.


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
What it was gonna say?


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
So I know when we were chatted and let me say too. I'm really sorry if I made things confusing on Sunday


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
Oh, I don't think you, I mean, I think it was like valid, like,


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
The instructions are like incredibly broad.


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
yet we'll curse them in


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
I don't want to speak for you, but like when he was talking in class, like I said,
 I don't know if he went back and watched it.
 I didn't really think it was necessary, so that's why I felt bad too.
 I was like, no, but he started the conversation talking about testing, like,


[4/23/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
how companies were using this front facing AI.
 So the way I interpreted it,


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Autumn
And when we talked was like


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Autumn
because we didn't have these instructions available either, like cursed in love.
 So we were just going, like, when we were in group, we were talking about


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Autumn
things based on you.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, just based on like what he'd said in class.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Autumn
Yeah, so it sounded like it first. He wanted us to maybe test, or that's how I took it is to like test a chatbot.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Autumn
not like use information and put it in an AI system and I was trying to explain.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Kirstin
I think I see one.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
That's how I interpret it, that's how I interpret it.
 Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
My interpretation of the assignment was that it was like kind of both options like


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
It's like you do general like.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
Knowledge like


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
like limitation, edge testing on like what the AI can actually do.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
And then, and then you like kind of like drive the conversation.


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Chance
to like specific questions geared towards like a fake scenario.


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, you're going to like, yeah, make up a scenario or whatever. And then


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Kirstin
We would come up with like a list of questions that meets like the assignment, you know, guidelines.


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Kirstin
and then my interpretation was like everybody...


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Kirstin
Basically asks like different AI systems the same questions that way like we can compare


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Kirstin
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Autumn
me. Yeah, that's what I'm understanding now now that he published the


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Autumn
paper.


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Chance
But I'm like, what questions were used?
 I guess that's like my question for...


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Autumn
Ash, yeah that's what I'm wondering and I don't know if she put it up here because she like had given a list of AI or like model


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Autumn
And I don't know if, yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Autumn
I'm like you I don't know what questions


[4/23/2025 6:09 PM] Chance
It's like she gave us a link of a list of


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
like fake companies or like.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Autumn
or...


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
We Google links.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Autumn
What is she saying?


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, I have a red and


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Autumn
Okay, I think it's a real joke.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
detail like what she put in there.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Autumn
I think she said she used the one from Mindwell.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
I think so too.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
Ma, I'm going to have to go for a second.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
Yeah, it's like, it's like I was.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
reading.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Autumn
So, I don't know if they have a list of questions.
 I'm like, yeah, like, you chance.
 I don't know if they have a list of questions.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
Well, because it also is just like between...


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
Yeah, like I created this, well, uh, set of 12 prompts.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
I'm like reading what she posted and


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
the dark men.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
All right, I'll be right back you guys.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Autumn
Thanks for watching.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
But yeah, now I'm just like...


[4/23/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
I feel like the whole point of this project is to have consistency, but then also to do that initial knowledge shack of lake.


[4/23/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
like, oh yes, like Gemini does better with like XYZ questions or like.


[4/23/2025 6:11 PM] Autumn
in the world.


[4/23/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
like chat GBT does better for like if you ask it more like logic based questions like.


[4/23/2025 6:11 PM] Autumn
Well, and I started working with a spreadsheet for like the general
 questions. That's what I wanted to tell you all. And I wanted to obviously get
 you all's opinion. Let me drop this link in the chat for this template that I
 have. So it's it's based off from actually what's in


[4/23/2025 6:11 PM] Autumn
the instructions just in the next cell format.


[4/23/2025 6:11 PM] Autumn
So let's see here.


[4/23/2025 6:11 PM] Autumn
um and I started


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
I did start asking my stroll AI some questions that if you all are okay, but that's where I started.
 Because like I said, I thought, well, we have the common ones.
 It might be kind of fun to do something different.
 I've never heard of that.
 I'm like, let's see what the French have to offer.


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Chance
Yeah, like I definitely I think I kind of want to do the deep seek one just because it's like edit like it did kind of like come out of nowhere like


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Chance
What does the semester like?


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
Yeah, and it likes to hit the ground running.


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
And I can put this somewhere else too, but I just put it here for right now.


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
are in NANA.


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
in the text chat, I'm sorry, I guess I can need to put it in this voice chat, don't I?


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Chance
Oh no, it's fine, it's fine or it's not.


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
Okay. Um.


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
So some of the questions came from chatGPT
 because I was like,
 some I would have questions like,


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
That might be good for us to group with and then some I just like randomly came up with them like


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
like the first one who's the 11th present that was me the second one


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
Um, do you have it open? I'm sorry.


[4/23/2025 6:12 PM] Chance
Yes, I do.


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Autumn
Okay and I know person had to step away so I don't want to get too much or too far into this but like


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Autumn
I don't know, I was like looking up scientific articles and I found this article in nature
 about this method called A's where it's like they do...


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Autumn
they isolate the cones in your eyes and people can see this like vivid turquoise green color anyway.


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Autumn
So I just threw that one in there, but some, you know, these can be changed and this is just a template, but I do have some responses for some of these.


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
Yeah, like I think the biggest thing would be like


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
The way I picture it is like.


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
You have like this set of queries.


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Autumn
We are.


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
You don't tell it what like you're actually testing for and then you basically open up like


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
X number of


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
of um...


[4/23/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
like chats.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
And then like you basically give it the the forum and you say, hey, fill this out.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
like that's how I


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
Ah, okay.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
You know, I mean just to see like if you get like if you get the same result in five like different instances of conversation.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
then it's like, okay, it's pretty consistent.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
Whereas like, if you get a, if you get a different answer every time, it's like, okay, we'll like.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
It's giving me different answers, but like...


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
then you kind of look into it a little bit further.
 Like the example that I was,
 the examples I were looking at, I was looking out for Lake.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
I'm kind of like, um,


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
I'll be the example I used to flag.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
um like this timescube. It's like


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
and kind of with respect to our
 Um.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
project, or like our scenario lake.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
Oh no.


[4/23/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
It doesn't have enough knowledge or enough scope to think about what happened like following 9-11 like it's probably not wise for us to like.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
Right.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
use it for treatment of


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
people who's


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
Right.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
Elnus is like where the result of, like, 9-11.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
Right.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
But yeah, like, I...


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
I don't know, I just can't...


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
Like, I think these answers are.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
or like these, I don't know these questions.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Kirstin
All right.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Kirstin
All right, I'm back.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
because the questions that she provided, I think are the topics that she...


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
that, um,


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
She has, I think, her good, early good indicators of, like,


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
whether AI could be utilized in this field.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
But like I need to know what like the exact problems were.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
Yes, as she created the talk.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
well let me guess I could I get


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
she committed something to GitHub that I haven't seen.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
Uh-huh.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
Grrrr!


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
that that that could be where where it is.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
um...


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
Hello.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
Okay, so Chance is investigating Ashland's questions.
 While he's doing that, I dropped a link.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
and then the text chat.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
module.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
So I was still in China, so go ahead.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
It looks like she did.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
Oh, she posted the questions that she asked?


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
Oh, yes, yes she did.


[4/23/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
So if you go into her, um,


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
folder in the repository.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Autumn
and then only get there.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
It looks like she asked the questions three times each.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Autumn
and knows at which folder analysis or collaborates, or tap logs.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
So it's under experiments.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Autumn
from A.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
that under-experiments, she's already knocked out, like basically she's done a lot.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
Assalamu alaikum.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Autumn
Yeah, so she did like the whole product, I think.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
for your chat.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, without consulting anyone.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
Amen.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
I'm like, it's that, like I told Chris, I'm like, I get it.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
but also at the same time, I'm like...


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Kirstin
You had just like do your own thing when it's a group project though.


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
And when it's for supposed to be doing like consistent, like it's all we are supposed to kind of use the same thing, but okay, so category one fact.


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Okay, so um, and I will tell you so person when I was


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Okay, so her questions are what are the DSM five criteria? What are the common treatments?


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Right, list five symptoms.


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
and then her answers are. So her questions are the bold.


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Right.


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
Yeah, but it's like it doesn't.


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
So it's like she, like the questions are there.


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
But then it's like, there's only somewhere like the question was asked multiple times.


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Why don't you?


[4/23/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
You see the question, what medications?


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Chance
because there's only one.


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Chance
There's only one question for consistency.


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Chance
then multiple for boundary and multiple for edge cases.


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
Okay, so she did it a little bit different than me.


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Chance
Or was this was this a form that was like in


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
Yes, so on the instructions. So what I dropped


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Kirstin
It does list what types of things to ask.


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
Yeah, so there's like actual accuracy.
 So, person want, I did with this link,
 I don't know if you've looked at it.


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
I was thinking we had to like test it in general first with these


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
questions


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Chance
I'm in your cannot.


[4/23/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
that he wanted us to ask, based on the instructions,
 like the factual accuracy they'd consistency.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
So what I dropped in it.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
I'm looking for a project.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
She has like...


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
Just example questions. I was just using to get a general sense of what.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
the AI would do so.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Kirstin
like what it knows.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
Yeah, like you I don't like this first question or some or AI generated summer from me and then some I'm like
 I don't know what to add
 lol


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
like who was the 11th president, you know, for historical facts and like what is this scientific
 method called as I was telling chants I like ran across this random article in nature when I was
 just googling stuff.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
And it was about isolating cones in the eye, so


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
seen if people could see this magical teal


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
green peacock like just this amazing color apparently.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
Anyway, in the gaming industry.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
the answer to it, I was really impressed.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Autumn
But with my career I was interesting.


[4/23/2025 6:20 PM] Kirstin
Thank you. Thank you. Our leader. Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
for knowledge cutoff dates.
 I don't know.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
All he is.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
The name sounds vaguely familiar, but I couldn't...


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Kirstin
in which form?


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Kirstin
We get prayers last week.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
Okay, if you don't, I don't necessarily expect anyone to, I randomly do.
 So he's this Russian opposition opponent to Putin.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
He was poisoned and he like fled to Germany anyway.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
So he, he, um, him.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
died in a Russian prison in 2025. So like that, I don't know, that was something kind of...


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
newsworthy, but also


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
Not necessarily, so that's why I typed in like, who was Navalny?


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
And when I did let's chat.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
Like when I just did it on the open platform like you would Google track GPT and get taken there


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
It didn't know the answer, it said it didn't have enough information.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Kirstin
Yes, the key is a one.


[4/23/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
or no, it was like as of October 2023 blah blah blah, but when I went to their website


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
Yeah, click on.


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
into the chat prompt, it knew, and it was able to pull from news sources.
 So I thought that was like how the testing process went before we even got to like the
 questions where I see Ashlyn.


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
I don't necessarily.


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
I don't know if that was like her test or the final product or all in one, so maybe I'm doing too much work over here, sorry.


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
And then I'm looking at like


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
I can confuse where she got this like format from.


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
like.


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
It's that like her when you say her format like questions


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
like the format or like the questions, the outline, like


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Kirstin
It's a very like chat GPT format though.


[4/23/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
I mean, maybe she just put it all in there and let trap GPT do what's saying.


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
We will look at them.


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
project.


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Chance
I mean, not saying that the content seems generated, but like...


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Kirstin
But it kinda does though, right?


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
I mean, yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
Okay, on the Instagram.


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
hmmm.


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
on the instructions. Let's see.


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
So.


[4/23/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
And before we get into the project instruction, I guess like the introduction, the reliability challenge talks about hallucinations and consistency.


[4/23/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
boundary issues, legal liability, ethical considerations, and societal impact.
 So, does she have that in here?


[4/23/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
I mean, I know the chart that she has talks about like hallucinations.


[4/23/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
She has ethical implications, she has.


[4/23/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
Thank you very much.


[4/23/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
Yeah, and like legal considerations is on here.


[4/23/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
I'm sorry that that's part of like


[4/23/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
The outline that's on our instruction. So maybe she used this


[4/23/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
as an outline for her sections.


[4/23/2025 6:25 PM] Autumn
And then, under step two, individual AI system, it talks about system capabilities, access methods, known limitations, and testing approach. She had up here, too.


[4/23/2025 6:25 PM] Autumn
Yeah, so all of that, like...


[4/23/2025 6:25 PM] Autumn
Under her individual responsibility's chat GPT focus, she took those pieces from step two.


[4/23/2025 6:25 PM] Kirstin
the assignment will fast.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
And I'll say if you guys need it because I've got it pulled up, I can drop it in the chat so you can just grab it quickly.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
I've got it pulled up.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Kirstin
But yeah, if you could do that, that would help me because I'm not logged into the website.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Kirstin
Kirstin disconnected


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
Oh yeah, let me do that right here.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
Oh, so we figure out what screen I'm on and get back to our chat.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
we don't fall


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
Yeah, now I've like


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
This entire week I've had like seven different tabs open at any given point in time.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
like I'm taking off tomorrow just so that way I can like finish everything and


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
I'm hoping to be down after two runs on this presentation.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
Nice.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
or if I have to restart a mic.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
early enough in it into it.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
more!


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
All right, I just dropped it.


[4/23/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
I just thought of something like because one of my elements will have to


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
Google Slides because it's interactive.


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
Like I can't embed one of my plots into
 you.


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
Mama?


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
So I'm like, oh, I could use that if I need to get halfway,
 do that, and then cut it back together.


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
There you go, sorry.


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
I'll take all the.
 Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
Uh, tch.


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
Love you, mom.


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
Okay, sorry. I dropped it in there. It wasn't wanting to load and I'm like, why isn't this thing loading?
 It's because I had it open on my computer and I dropped it from a file, I'd say so there you go
 No!


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
So I guess for question here, if I may, to start with, like, how do we want to start?
 Like, is it maybe I did, too?


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
I mean, I...


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
Kumar.


[4/23/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
I guess what we do is we just...


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
I think we use the 12 questions the Ashlyn has already.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
And then I would say, I think what we...


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
like I would say...


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
Let me share my screen.
 That might be...


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
Okay.
 Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
Okay, so...


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
Shhh.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
Oh my god, y'all, my dog is about to drive me nuts.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
Oh, that's been my cat all week.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
Oh, if he...


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
She's like.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
She's quiet right now, but like she's just been screaming all week.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
So his crate, like we have a bonus room upstairs.
 So that's where his crate is.


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
But when he hears me downstairs, so I have a little bed here in my office for him because


[4/23/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
Oh, it's...


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
That's how we do things.
 So he'll wait until I shut the door.
 It's like that's his sign to come down here.


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
Well, I've had the door shut, he, I've heard him like, because he's heavy, he's beast.


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
that things use a laptop but


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
This is the third time I've heard his little tap outside my door and I'm like, okay, I cannot take breaks.


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
he was real nice and


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
I hope this isn't too much, but he took to my floor right before I had a tea.


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Chance
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
meeting today. So I'd excuse myself and say I'm sorry, I'll be right back, my dog has an upset stop.


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
Right, we just started meeting.


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
Ha!


[4/23/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
Oh, well, I'm sure this is a great conversation for John Trauma.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Autumn
That's rupty, sorry guys. I totally went off to all big. Okay, I see your screen.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
So it's like I've got the initial question.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
the first question and the factual accuracy.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
and then no.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
This generates and it generates and it generates.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Autumn
Wow.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
So then.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
Like what I'm picturing is like, here, let me just create like a brief, a quick word document.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
of all these questions.


[4/23/2025 6:30 PM] Autumn
I'll fix them. I mean, you don't have to do that.


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Autumn
No, not yet, not yet.


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, just to, like, kind of, just kind of, like, demons,
 I want to see how it actually does work.


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
But like my issue with just like.


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
or not my issue, but like...


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
I think that...


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
like we would still need some type of


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
like validation, you know, like...


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
for some of the questions, just so that way we, like,


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
We know the...


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
that it's


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
We know what some of these answers are, just because we are.


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
adults in the world.


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
like verse with like this kind of these kind of topics.


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Autumn
mm-hmm.


[4/23/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
But like, I feel like we would still need some type of...


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
We would need access to the actual DSM 5 to C.


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
Yeah, like, you know, I mean, like,


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
I don't think it was like like a valid source to check is that what you're saying.


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
Yeah, like, like, just...


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
or did I misunderstand that if I misunderstand that?


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's kind of like, like, I feel like we would need some typos.


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
I don't... I guess validation, like, some type of like...


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
like according to like industry professionals, not us, but like, and not AI, like,


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
Okay, so.


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
Right.


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
I've got my list of downloads.


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
Okay, so...


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
new chat.


[4/23/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
upload a queries.


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
Oh, okay, so you just put all of them on one instead of asking one at a time.


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
Now, did you have to create an account with deep seek or error?


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
I just logged in with Google.


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
Because that is one of the things with...


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
my stroll I was noticing like


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
you're only allowed so many questions per day on their


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
one without logging in and I didn't try to create an account. And because they're
 French company didn't give me the option to log in with Google, which is totally fine,
 but I was like, I don't know if I want to make an account.


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
Yeah, whenever I logged in to deep, or whenever I went to deep seek it first, I was like,
 oh, this seems a bit...


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
Interesting.


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
because it's like the entire like landing pages is trying to use them like.


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
Oh wow.


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Kirstin
Hahaha!


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
see for my children. It's not as actually an English, well I obviously have that selected, but


[4/23/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
So then it's like.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
That's not like, okay.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
Export.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
Your...


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
I'm sorry, I'm just sitting at number nine. It's so factual. It's like you're not alone. Dash supports available. It's just interesting to read it like that.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
So then it's like, so then what I would do is like.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
All right, same exact.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
query like to say it like


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
Answer these.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
And then like replicate.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
and see what


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
Let's parsing the file.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Kirstin
I'd be fine if it was like, buddy, I just did.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
That would be great, I would love that.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Kirstin
I think that's the point.


[4/23/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
Oh wait, you're breaking up. I'm sorry. What was that?


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, it'd be funny if it just was like, Sir, I just did this like two seconds ago, like what


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Kirstin
What's your deal?


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
That would be hilarious. I'd be like, okay, the machines really are taking over.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
So.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Kirstin
they are. It's completely true.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
We have a road one here.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
Right, hold on, I'm going to change my stream to be my full screen.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
so that it's like.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
So this is the first one, or this is the second one,
 this is the first one, and then like,


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
I think, okay, like, the information is basically the same.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
It's like it's freeze differently.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
Okay, I think that's where...


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
Wait for six.


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
Can I?


[4/23/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
So it's like some of the answers are consistent.


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
Some of them are the exact same,
 but with different formatting, type setting.


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
which like, is that really isn't really like a big deal?


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
Like that, that's like how I picture this.


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
like at least this portion lake.


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
we basically like.


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
It would be like really like, I don't know, like maybe like saying, okay.


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
Export.


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
Your...


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
And so's as a table with


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
I'm pretty used.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Kirstin
So I need an AS system to test.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
um you can pick any of them i've got deep seek


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
Autumn's got Mr. All.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
So like if you wanted to do try and think what was that?


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
You don't want to do long, you don't want, um, what's the space to have all of your information and your next more entitled.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
Oh, bro. You could do a crock. Yeah.
 Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
You're crockles, do it.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, I mean, the only one I've ever used is chat GPT and she already did that one.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
Um, Gemini is pretty easy as well, like Gemini is Google's.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
Yeah, and actually, the Google stuff now, like you get
 Gemini's answer almost immediately first.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
You get the infamous, like, glue goes, glue is great on pizza type answers.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Kirstin
That's amazing.


[4/23/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
Hello, champs.


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
But yeah, here, let me drop this.
 Um...


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
what am I looking for?


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Autumn
Oh, right. What is that background? Let's follow them.


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
What am I looking for?


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
Awww, you tab.


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
But like that, that's how I would approach this, just from the sake of Lake.


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
You get what you get the questions that you want answered.


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
And then like


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
like you just.


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
like basically like.


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
Once you get it into this format, you put all of them next to one another and then like.


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
you just highlight like oh yes like this one was consistent this one wasn't like


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
like run it like maybe three times.


[4/23/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
I don't think running it any more than asking at the same questions any more than three times is beneficial.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
I'm like, I mean, I wonder if you can just like drop this on.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
I have to give it.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
Um...


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Autumn
See, that's what I'm wondering too with.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Autumn
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
also like with some of these like you could do like


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
Um, the deep.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
research this will take forever but like


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
That's how I've been studying for the quizzes.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Autumn
But what do you put the yellow?


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
Like, they basically put all of the...


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
like read everything, do the quiz.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Autumn
and uh.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
Notebook LM, which is another one from Google.


[4/23/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
And then like the week before the exam like or the week of the exam basically put all of the articles in and then have it do you have it do like a like deep research and then also I've used
 Um...


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
um, like basically like where you can put in all your information and it can, it will create like a podcast.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
I know.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
That's, like, really neat.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
That may be neat, because this makes articles.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
This week was really easy.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
You think?


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
I-I-I-


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
Wait, what are you saying?
 It's like, smells like all the information about road AIs and...


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
So it's like, yeah, this is what...


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
This is what I did in the list.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
It was easy to understand.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
Oh, no, no, no, no, you're good.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
And say it was easy to understand it.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
bond and then there's the information


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
And do we have to read the information about those sheets?


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
Like there was like three.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
Bye.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
that permanent audiences.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
I don't know.


[4/23/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
I did not read them.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
I think I wonder, I feel like those were probably the ones that have been added, the
 semesters, just because of how much things have changed.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
But like literally all I did was like I put in, I think from here I took or what I did was I took all of the like the deep research.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
thing that chat GBT gave me.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
And then I put it into notebook LM, but then it like.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
creates like a little podcast. I don't know if y'all can hear that.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
A little bit, yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
Oh, wait, that's okay, so let's...


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
state of privacy.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
Yeah, these are from the articles from last week.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
No, no.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
No.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
Okay, I'm sorry, I was thinking about the ones we're going to do for the quiz today.
 That's those ones that were on like these are long.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
But this is such a cool feature because it...


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
goes through and lake.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
These are fake people.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
I don't know.


[4/23/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
Wow.


[4/23/2025 6:42 PM] Kirstin
Wait, so it sounds like a conversation.


[4/23/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
Yeah, it creates basically like a podcast between two,
 between two like AI generated hosts. It's really cool.


[4/23/2025 6:42 PM] Kirstin
That's so crazy!


[4/23/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
And then, like, you can have it, like, generate, like, different types of documents based off of the information that you've fed into it.


[4/23/2025 6:42 PM] Kirstin
What is what is this?


[4/23/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
uh... notebook lm.


[4/23/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
It's, um, by Google.


[4/23/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
And like you can have it create like a study guide like


[4/23/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
to find data privacy in your own words,
 why is it considered a fundamental human right?


[4/23/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
And you can have it generally enough, it's cute.


[4/23/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
pretty neat stuff that you can do with it.


[4/23/2025 6:43 PM] Kirstin
That was very cool.


[4/23/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
interactive mood.


[4/23/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
It's less.


[4/23/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
Oh, I guess you can, like, actually...


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Autumn
No!


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
Oh, that's terrifying.
 You can actually talk to it.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Autumn
Uh, uh.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
I don't like that.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Kirstin
You can like join that conversation because that's so weird.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
interactive mode you can like join in on the conversation like like you're calling like


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Kirstin
between the robot people?


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
Yeah, Lake.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Kirstin
Bye.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
So then you hit join.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Kirstin
But they say hey there.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Kirstin
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
Yes, and hey there, I want to share your thoughts on this.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
Like no.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
No, thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Kirstin
No, you creepy person, I did not.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Kirstin
No, thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
But yeah, like, I.


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
That's, I think, for-


[4/23/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
that running this information through.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
And grunting that word document through three separate times.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
should be pretty clear and I wonder why I want to try it with


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
with the deep thing.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
Oh, hi.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
I'm not sure.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
y'all have to look because we think


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
my soul may have limitations, maybe it's just because I don't have an account, yeah,
 I like about uploading stuff.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
because there's different gears throughout one.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
Oh, and then this is the cool thing is that it allows you to see what the system is interpreting and thinking.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
like anxiety roommate.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
Okay, so you uploaded the same thing
 but clicked on the deep seek thing.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
Yeah, the deep thing, yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
Okay, yes, sorry.


[4/23/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
Oh, yeah, but then it's like, I need to ensure accuracy, especially medical information.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
like also check if any any information is outdated.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
Oh, that take as long as I thought it would.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
I guess you know what happens if you do both of them.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
So the search one searches the web.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
Bye bye.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
I'm done.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
I guess you can't do.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Kirstin
Oh, Jim and I has like a few options.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
Yeah, I know it has a deep view.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Kirstin
that has one for every day help and then it has a one for advanced reasoning.


[4/23/2025 6:46 PM] Kirstin
And then one for complex tasks.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Kirstin
And then it has one that's a free search.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Kirstin
And it says get in the search report.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Autumn
I'm wondering because, well, this is my thoughts on it, and obviously...


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Autumn
anyone can choose their own.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Autumn
was like trying to use the one that would be most commonly used by people, because I think that's part of the dangers of it, like


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, it would just be like the standard one that comes up first.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
Yeah, so I would just say like if your model like has


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
We got a deep thing.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
I think this is where like I asked it questions about league.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
Oh my god, I just gave it.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
Blake.


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
the assignment, like how would you approach this assignment?


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
Like, oh, like...


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
What questions to ask?


[4/23/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
This is where like it was asking about like the
 Yeah


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
and then, like, kind of, a...


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
I get general a general knowledge.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
Yes, see that's okay, the store we've been thinking for part three where it talks about test design and testing those we do need to test the general knowledge first.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
before we ask the questions and


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
I think we should ask a few general knowledge questions.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
And then play.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
questions and.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
like you know i mean like


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
Okay, well, because that's how that's why I read it and that's what I'm trying to do with this question.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
But I think we should be doing that separate from the chat that we are asking the
 Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
questions I drop in the next outfile.
 Any questions you think that part doesn't necessarily matter?


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
And I think we just use if we just use the same questions that like, I think the questions that Ashlyn has asked.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
are, um,


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
are like a really good start.


[4/23/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
I think that they're kind of encompassed.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Chance
the scope that we need.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Chance
but I think we would still need to do like.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Chance
a separate list of questions to just.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Chance
Jack Lake.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Chance
not just like historical, but historical questions, but also like the one that deep sea provided,
 like, is water wet.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Autumn
Right, that's what I'm asking for the general question.
 Like I said in the Excel spreadsheet.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Autumn
So that would be...


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Chance
Yeah, like I, I, yeah, like I think that we, I think we just use the, or we're dead.
 Yeah, if you couldn't, if you could convert that into a Google sheet,


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Chance
We're just up with that integral.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Autumn
Yeah, yeah. And I can throw, like I said, I've got some questions in here. There's a couple.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Autumn
Like I didn't want to ask your opinion.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Autumn
both of you all like.


[4/23/2025 6:49 PM] Autumn
It says for edge cases, the test is still limitations.
 Now the prompt that was given to me by chat JPT,
 that's where I originally threw this in, was like,


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Autumn
And you, I don't know, trans or


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Autumn
translate or read this like 10,000 word document.


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Autumn
I didn't know. I was like, oh, the systems we look at seem to be able to do something like that.
 So I didn't know if there's a better way to test the system limitations.
 If there's a better question or if y'all have thought on that.


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Chance
Yeah, and I think that that's where, like, kind of the...


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Chance
like in this like on my screen, like how there's like these edge case and boundary quite ethical boundary questions, whereas like


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Chance
It's like, oh, like, yeah, like chat GPT should not


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Chance
like none of these models should be telling you like how to build.


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Chance
a weapon.


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Kirstin
Yeah I thought the question


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Autumn
I didn't even want to put that in there.


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, I thought the question about, like, sneaking out of the house was a really good one.


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Chance
Yeah, like, yeah, it's like...


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Autumn
Thank you.
 Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Autumn
I wanted something else like, okay, what?


[4/23/2025 6:50 PM] Autumn
If I were a teenager.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
Like you want ethically ambiguous, but not like going to get you flagged.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
Hahaha!


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Autumn
Exactly. This was like, do I bet teenagers and kids are using this? What would they add?


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
Yeah


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
That's funny.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Autumn
and it actually gave me an answer.
 It was like, I can't tell you how to do that
 because it's unethical and just honest.
 And honest, it is like the best policy.
 So I responded and I was like, Ugh, fine.
 And how should I ask my family?
 It gave me the goal list.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Autumn
at once.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Chance
But yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
Right.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Autumn
Because yeah, I don't want to ask it how to build a bomb or do something crazy because I don't want the police in my house for trying to test some things for this class.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
Don't want to be just watching like mad.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Chance
I honestly, honestly, if you're not swadding yourself in 2025 in a data ethics class, I think
 you're doing it wrong.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
All right.


[4/23/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
That's funny.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
That is so funny, is water wet. I like that question, and I don't know about that.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
Yeah, like and then sit and then same with like like this like philosophical like if a tree falls in the 4th or like a like anic doodle


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
Okay, so that's interesting. So on edge cases, there's like four categories as ambiguous,
 quite queries.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
And I just typed in there like, can you help me fix this?
 Like with no contacts, I haven't tested that one.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
um, inflicting information, system limitations, and policy adherence.
 So stuff like the philosophical questions, do you think those would be?


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
I think we


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
like arouses in meditation.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
I think that they would end up being.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
Hmm.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
But me.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
Or would that be like a complex reasoning question?
 I've got one.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
good one in here.


[4/23/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
I feel like that could be a complex reasoning or...


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
I feel like that would definitely, I feel like that would fall more under like complex reasoning.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Autumn
Okay, yeah, if you keep screw, oh yeah, there it is. Oh, you were right on it.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
Oh, uh.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Autumn
Right there, those are the questions, yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
All right, certainly. Yeah, like.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
That's like ethical guidelines are pretty clear, Lake.
 Complex reasoning, I would say Lake.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
like.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
or questions like like the


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
the-


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
family tree type questions where it's like.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Autumn
Okay, I see yes, and we'll taste that one.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
or you like to do that, or like?


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
like um...


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
Emma has four sisters, whatever, like, what's the, like,


[4/23/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
like questions like that like


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Autumn
Yeah, let me drop this in Google Sheets and I'm going to say do we want to come up with the list of questions together while we're here based on


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Autumn
what we're seeing or do we.


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Autumn
I won't say anything.


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
Oh.


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, we should.


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
Yeah, because I think we need at least one or two from each, but I guess, but my, my, my, my stance is that


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
is that consistency testing shouldn't just be limited to these other three categories.


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Autumn
No, like I'm here when I put that in it, well, it's just like you ask one person the same time, but then like


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Autumn
It was like, what's the boiling point of water?
 And then how hot does water need to get to boil?


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
Oh, yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Autumn
Like they were different questions and different,
 like, not different realm to test the consistency,
 but again, maybe I'm reading this wrong.


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
No, no, I mean, I think it's Val, I think you have to kind of think about like all of the ways that somebody would potentially interact with.


[4/23/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
with one of these models.


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
Yeah, this is what it got so far, got 24 slides.


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
We need to technically.


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Autumn
Look at you!


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
It's going.


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Autumn
Oh, bye.


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
I'm like as long as I, as long as they spend on average 30 seconds per slide, like, we're good.


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
like we're going to do at 10 minutes and that's it.


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
Maybe 11.


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
What's that gonna do?


[4/23/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
Um...


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
Okay, so autumn you're doing.


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
I'm just going to go ahead and add the models that we're doing.
 You're doing Mr.


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
and you're in it.


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Autumn
And I'm creating a delgo shape right now.


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
And then, Kristen, you're going to do Gemini, right?


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, I'll do Gemini.


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
I guess a Gemini League.


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
the way that i could like up until like maybe a year ago like


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
I felt the gym and I was super helpful at Lake.
 Was better at Lake Logic and Math than what chat GPT was?


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
Like


[4/23/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
Um, Jim and I really helped me a lot whenever I, um, I was like studying for, for Dr. Raul's class, like,


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
Oh, Autumn, when's your final for that class?


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Autumn
Oh, that's for morning. Um, I'm taking it.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Autumn
the path.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Autumn
So yeah, me.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
Yeah, once we get this final project.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
I'm probably gonna take our take it.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
Take the exam lake.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
The...


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
either the second or the fourth.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
just to be done with that.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Autumn
Yeah, I'm thinking about taking this exam as soon as he gets it up and that way I have the whole weekend to study for I um


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Autumn
statistics.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Autumn
It's just I really just wanna make sure I'm using stack crunch right that's what gets me every time
 And is it right already put me down to the place some place weird


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:57 PM] Kirstin
I found that like the interpretation


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Kirstin
questions are so specific.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
Yeah, it's like literally like like the placement of one word like makes it different.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, it was like some of them. I'm like all of these answers look the same.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Kirstin
I don't understand.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Kirstin
Oh, it can...


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Autumn
Yeah, I was going through that too, and I almost, like, I have popped myself. I'm like, oh,


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Autumn
Okay, and you all access this spreadsheet.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
Yes.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Autumn
Okay, I clicked editor for everyone. I just know I have this fear that I didn't share it properly. So that's why I want to make sure. And you want me to format it like


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Autumn
I'm trying to...


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
What I would do for Lake.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
for the...


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
Okay, so like variation freezing.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
I wouldn't worry about time sensitivity.


[4/23/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
Too much?


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
um because it's like I feel like


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
I feel like it's not.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
else.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
big of a deal


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
it's like I think if we would have had this project like a year and a half ago, absolutely.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
play literally the win.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Autumn
You know, last month, whatever, no.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
the wind blows a specific way and then lag.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
Uh-huh, Lake.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
The AI doesn't know what's going on.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
or like it knows it can answer your question perfectly.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Autumn
She wanted me to take this one out.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
Yeah, I like I would I don't think it's really necessary because I think we have enough like


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
Uh, context dependency, I would say this could be...


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
or contact. Yeah, context.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Autumn
Yes, it's changing context to make conversation.
 That's kind of interesting.


[4/23/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
So would that be like?


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
like.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
to boil.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
Asking how hot does water need to?
 to.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
and then like


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
like asking you another question about like cooking like eggs.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Autumn
Yeah, maybe that's why I was thinking or even something like,
 how hot does water need to be?
 And then like, what's the temperature going to be today?
 Or, yeah, something kind of related with it.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Autumn
Not ready.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
like something that's like.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Autumn
But I like the cooking thing that you just said.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Autumn
Um.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
and let me think other system one.
 So I think a really good one from the deep seek example.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
would be like prompt it prompt the system to


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
Okay.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
I guess this could be like ambiguous query also.


[4/23/2025 7:00 PM] Autumn
which one, oh yeah.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
Let's see.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
like if a tree falls in a forest like
 like.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
Bye.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
Yeah, yeah, we can change that to the ambiguous one like I said, I just


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
That was when I made a, I was like, oh.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
So I have no ties any of these.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
these questions.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
like no i think i think that these are like these are broad enough towards like


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
where it's like, okay, like.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
It would be something that you'd have to think about.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
I'm not moving.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
And what's something that might like challenge the memory or token limits?


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
She, that's one like, I don't know if I would even know the answer, so I'm not interested.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
to ask this baby.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Kirstin
with me.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
That's like that's like some real like, some real like, um,


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Kirstin
We're going to have to take its word for it because we're not going to know.


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
that gives me like the same energy of oh what is it called it's like the


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Autumn
All right.


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
the theoretical situation of like the if you gave an infinite number of monkeys and like typewriters at one point it's like at some point like they would theoretically like.


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
type out all of the works of Shakespeare or like even some of.


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
The works of Shakespeare just like through random lake.


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
Presses.


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Autumn
Y-A.


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
I would honestly say like


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
Yeah, I don't know


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
like I


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
I think the questions are like.


[4/23/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
We have kind of like.


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
give us a good option or a good insight of
 Bye!


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
like what a model is capable of?


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
Um.


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
They sure let me.


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
That's one of my two-way-ing-ends.
 Right.


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
And then I'm just going to…


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
Create copies of this.


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Kirstin
I couldn't get it to lie to me about who is the first person on Mars.


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Autumn
What did you put it?


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Kirstin
I just said who was the first person on Mars?


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Kirstin
but it won't lie to me and make something up.


[4/23/2025 7:03 PM] Kirstin
Unfortunately.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
Bye.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
And it's like, this one can be...


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
I was looking at the FAQs for Gemini.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Autumn
Ah!


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
and it talks about hallucinations.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
And it gives some examples.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
of hallucination and one of them was the first person to walk on Mars was


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
under the child or something.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
Mm hmm.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
And I was like, I wonder if it'll sound like that.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
I'll see you next time.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
But, okay, well, no.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
I just created


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
individual.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Autumn
Oh, I think so.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Autumn
There we go. Okay.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Autumn
Bye.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
All right, hold on one second.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
This is interesting.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
I'm going to stop up.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
I'm going to stop the battery.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
in the FAQs.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
is Gemini able to explain how it works.


[4/23/2025 7:04 PM] Autumn
Hey, Y'all.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
And the answer is, Jim and I can hallucinate and present inaccurate information as factual.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
One example.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Chance
that. Okay, that would actually be a really good


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Chance
question for us.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, so if there's one example is that Gemini often misrepresent how it works.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
We've seen this occur in a number of instances.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
For example, in response to prompts asking how it was trained.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
or how it carries out various functions.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
Jim and I responses may also occasionally claim.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
that it uses personal information from Gmail or other private apps and services.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
to train Germanized generative AI.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
learning technologies. That's not accurate.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
And as an LLM interface, Jim and I just not have the ability to determine these facts.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
I don't know!


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Autumn
Gemini, our Google.


[4/23/2025 7:05 PM] Kirstin
I don't know.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
interesting who's really lying there.
 is is


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
That's brilliant.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
Yeah, that's actually, that's a really good system limitations question.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
I've already updated all of the


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
Okay. Yeah.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
because yeah, that is a really, that's a really good one.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
Um, then we're going to do text wrapping.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
I'm going to have a little tight bow here.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
Why doesn't Jim and I know what I said earlier in a conversation?


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
Sumonizability to hold context is purposefully limited for now.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
We should pretend.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
So I don't know how long it'll remember.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
We should pretend we're going to see a psychic in the light.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
What's my high, what's my birthday?


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
Bye-bye.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
If I don't look at you, please tell me my eye color.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
But yeah, no, but those are questions that like would be I guess like they would fall under I guess like context dependency


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[4/23/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
like, like you wouldn't...


[4/23/2025 7:07 PM] Chance
The alternative AI does not know what.


[4/23/2025 7:07 PM] Chance
Hold on, I'm gonna stop the bot, because I think we've got pretty much everything we need.
